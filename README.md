# SoMe-campaign-report

My first social media campaign report created using Power BI, showcasing key metrics and insights.

## Project overview
This Power BI report was created using a dummy dataset to simulate a real-world social media campaign. The campaign was about World Heart Day, with a duration of 1 month. The main objective - to compare the performance of two different social media channels —Facebook and LinkedIn — by visualizing key metrics.

## Key metrics
The report highlights these KPIs: conversions, conversion rate, ad spend, cost per conversion. Also, included metrics such as CTR, CPC, CPM. 

## How to use
Power BI Desktop: Download and open the .pbit file using Power BI Desktop to try the interactive report.
